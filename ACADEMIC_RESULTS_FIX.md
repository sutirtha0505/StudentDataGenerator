# Academic Results Generation Fix

## Issue Identified
The application was hanging at the academic results section when running interactively because:
1. `scanner.hasNext()` was blocking indefinitely waiting for input
2. No timeout mechanism was in place for interactive detection
3. When users pressed Ctrl+C, it would interrupt and go to automatic mode

## Solution Implemented
1. **Replaced blocking input detection** with a timeout-based approach
2. **Added 5-second timeout** for user input detection
3. **Clear messaging** about the three available options:
   - Type 'y' for custom configuration
   - Type 'n' to skip academic results
   - Press Enter or wait 5 seconds for automatic generation

## Code Changes
- Updated the academic results section in `Main.java` (around line 1460)
- Replaced `scanner.hasNext()` with `System.in.available()` and timeout logic
- Added proper exception handling for input detection errors

## How It Works Now
1. **Interactive Mode**: Run `java -cp "dependencies\*;." Main`
2. **At Academic Results Section**: 
   - Shows prompt: "Do you want to generate academic results? (y/n) [Press Enter for automatic]:"
   - Waits 5 seconds for user input
   - If no input: Automatically generates academic results
   - If 'y': Asks for custom configuration
   - If 'n': Skips academic results entirely

## Testing Results
✅ **Automatic timeout works**: No input leads to automatic generation after 5 seconds
✅ **Interactive input works**: Typing 'y' or 'n' works as expected  
✅ **No more hanging**: Application never gets stuck waiting for input
✅ **Proper error handling**: Gracefully handles interrupted input

## Usage Examples

### Quick Interactive (Let it auto-generate)
```
java -cp "dependencies\*;." Main
# Enter your school details
# When prompted for academic results, just press Enter or wait 5 seconds
```

### Custom Academic Results
```
java -cp "dependencies\*;." Main
# Enter your school details  
# When prompted for academic results, type 'y' and press Enter
# Then provide class range, terms, and year
```

### Skip Academic Results
```
java -cp "dependencies\*;." Main
# Enter your school details
# When prompted for academic results, type 'n' and press Enter
```
