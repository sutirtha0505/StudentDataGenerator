## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
1. **Java 8 or higher** (Tested with Java 17)
2. **PostgreSQL** installed and running (Local instance)
3. **Dependencies** (All included in `dependencies/` folder):
   - HikariCP 6.0.0 (Connection pooling)
   - SLF4J API 2.0.13 (Logging abstraction)
   - SLF4J Simple 2.0.13 (Logging implementation)
   - PostgreSQL JDBC 42.7.4 (Database driver)

## üì¶ Database Setup

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
Download and install PostgreSQL from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

### 2. Create Database
Connect to PostgreSQL (using psql or pgAdmin) and run:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_management;
```

### 3. Update Configuration
Open `Main.java` and update these constants if needed:
```java
private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/student_management";
private static final String DB_USER = "postgres";
private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "Sutirtha_05@Postgress"; // Update with your password
```

## üöÄ How to Run

### Quick Start (Recommended)
Use the provided PowerShell scripts for easy execution:

#### 1. Compile
```powershell
.\compile.ps1
```

#### 2. Run Options
- **Quick Test** (Small dataset): `.\quick_test.ps1`
- **Large Dataset Test**: `.\large_dataset.ps1` 
- **Interactive Mode**: `.\interactive_enhanced.ps1`
- **Full Interactive**: `.\interactive.ps1`

### Manual Compilation and Execution

#### 1. Compile
```powershell
javac -cp "dependencies\*" -d . Main.java
```

#### 2. Run
```powershell
java -cp "dependencies\*;." Main
```

### Three Academic Results Modes

The application now supports three modes for academic results generation:

#### 1. **Interactive Mode**
- Type `y` when prompted for academic results
- Customize class range, terms per year, and session year
```
Do you want to generate academic results? (y/n) [Press Enter for automatic]: y
Enter the classes for which you want to generate results (e.g., '1-3' or '6-8'): 1-5
Enter number of terms per year: 3
Enter session year: 2025
```

#### 2. **Automatic Mode** 
- Press Enter or wait 5 seconds at the academic results prompt
- Uses school structure parameters automatically
- Generates results for all classes with default settings (3 terms, current year)

#### 3. **Skip Mode**
- Type `n` when prompted for academic results
- Skips academic results generation entirely

### 4. Follow Prompts
The application will ask for:
- Number of classes per school (e.g., 12)
- Number of sections per class (e.g., 4)
- Number of students per section (e.g., 30)
- Number of schools to generate (e.g., 10)
- Academic results preference (y/n or wait for automatic)

    school_uuid UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    school_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```

### Student Tables (one per school)
```sql

    student_uuid UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    guardian_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    blood_group VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,

    -- Grand totals
    grand_total INTEGER,
    percentage_grand_total DECIMAL(5,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üéì Academic Features

The application now supports intelligent academic results generation with three distinct modes:

### Academic Results Generation Modes

#### 1. **Interactive Mode** (Custom Configuration)
```
Do you want to generate academic results? (y/n) [Press Enter for automatic]: y
Enter the classes for which you want to generate results (e.g., '1-3' or '6-8'): 6-10
Enter number of terms per year: 2
Enter session year: 2025
```

#### 2. **Automatic Mode** (Smart Defaults)
```
Do you want to generate academic results? (y/n) [Press Enter for automatic]: [ENTER]
No input provided within 5 seconds. Generating academic results automatically...
Automatically generating academic results for all 12 classes...
Configuration:
  Class Range: 1-12 (all classes in school structure)
  Terms per Year: 3
  Session Year: 2025
```

#### 3. **Skip Mode** (No Academic Results)
```
Do you want to generate academic results? (y/n) [Press Enter for automatic]: n
Academic results generation skipped by user.
```

### Academic Data Generation Process
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-second timeout prevents hanging
- **Class Selection**: Enter class range (e.g., '1-3' or '6-8') or auto-detect from school structure
- **Term Configuration**: Specify number of terms per academic year (default: 3)
- **Subject Setup**: Automatic subject configuration based on class level
- **Historical Records**: Generates academic progression (Class 3 student gets records for Classes 1, 2, 3)

### Academic Table Naming
- Pattern: `{sanitized_school_name}_class_{class_number}_{session_year}`
- Example: `st_mary_public_school_class_1_2025`

### Subject Configuration by Class Level
- **Classes 1-5**: Bengali, English, Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Arts and Crafts, Physical Education
- **Classes 6-8**: Bengali, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Computer Science, Physical Education
- **Classes 9-10**: Bengali, English, Mathematics, Physical Science, Life Science, Geography, History, Computer Science, Physical Education
- **Classes 11-12**: Stream-based subjects (Science/Commerce/Arts) with advanced curriculum

### Mark Generation Algorithm
- **Realistic Distribution**: 40-100% of full marks with weighted probability
- **Performance Patterns**: Consistent student performance with natural variation
- **Automatic Calculations**: Term totals, percentages, and grand totals
- **Grade Assignment**: Based on percentage ranges
```

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed operations
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams and batching prevent OutOfMemoryError

### Scalability Features
- **Large Dataset Support**: Tested with 100K+ students
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjusts thread pool and connection pool based on system resources
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents hanging with configurable timeouts
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of database connection issues

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
1. **PostgreSQL not running**: Start PostgreSQL service
   ```powershell
   # Windows
   net start postgresql-x64-15
   ```
2. **Connection refused**: Check if PostgreSQL is accepting connections
   ```sql
   -- Test connection
   psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d student_management
   ```
3. **Authentication failed**: Verify username and password in `Main.java`
4. **Database doesn't exist**: Create the database first
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE student_management;
   ```

### Compilation Issues
1. **Java not found**: Install Java and verify installation
   ```powershell
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```
2. **Dependencies missing**: Ensure all JARs are in `dependencies/` folder
   ```
   dependencies/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HikariCP-6.0.0.jar
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slf4j-api-2.0.13.jar
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slf4j-simple-2.0.13.jar
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ postgresql-42.7.4.jar
   ```
3. **Classpath issues**: Use the provided PowerShell scripts or correct classpath syntax

### Runtime Issues
1. **Academic results hanging**: Fixed with 5-second timeout mechanism
2. **Memory issues**: Increase heap size for large datasets
   ```powershell
   java -Xmx8g -cp "dependencies\*;." Main
   ```
3. **Too many connections**: Reduce thread count or increase PostgreSQL max_connections
4. **Input encoding issues**: Ensure terminal supports UTF-8

### Performance Issues
1. **Slow generation**: Check system resources and database performance
2. **Connection timeouts**: Increase connection timeout in HikariCP configuration
3. **Large dataset failures**: Use batch processing and monitor memory usage

### Common Error Messages
- **"No suitable driver"**: PostgreSQL JDBC driver missing from classpath
- **"Connection refused"**: PostgreSQL service not running
- **"OutOfMemoryError"**: Increase JVM heap size or reduce dataset size
- **"Scanner closed"**: Timeout mechanism activated, behavior is normal
